## Our project: 

We developed a new web application based on the hackathon's theme of ==Self-Improvement==!

Our project revolutionizes the self-improvement journey by providing users with fulfillment through actionable tasks and gamified goals. This is no ordinary task app. Through ==Nurture==, we empower individuals to stay accountable and motivated, all while providing that much needed daily dopamine hit to keep you focused.
