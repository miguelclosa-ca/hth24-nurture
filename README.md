## Our project: Nurture

We developed a new web application based on the hackathon's theme of **Self-Improvement**!

*This is no ordinary task app.*

Our project revolutionizes the self-improvement journey by providing users with fulfillment through actionable tasks and gamified goals. 
Through **Nurture**, we empower individuals to stay accountable and motivated, all while providing that much needed daily dopamine hit to keep you focused.

### How it works:

Each day, every task you add to **Nurture** will grow as a new leaf. 
Every task can be edited or removed as you see fit. 
By the end of the day, if you successfully complete all your tasks, your plant will bloom into a beautiful **FLOWER**!
